## üìñ Introduction

SlopeCraft is created using Qt + Eigen + zlib for creating 3D pixel map arts within Minecraft.

The difference between this program and SpriteCraft is that this program focuses on pixel art on maps. Its purpose is to
record the pixel art with the map, then display it in an item frame (the map here refers to the in-game item, and not
the saving files).

The color modification module is targeted towards the map. The pixel art is meant to resemble the art in the "point of
view" of the map - not of the player.

Since the color within the map is related to the relative height of the block, the pixel art created by SlopeCraft is
usually in 3D, which I call 3D Pixel Art.

In summary, SlopeCraft is created for map pixel art.

This is why maps made by SlopeCraft have higher quality than exporting a picture from SpriteCraft then recording it with
a map - because SlopeCraft is specifically designed for map pixel art.
